# Delivery Service App 

As of 26-May-2021, one can view this application hosted [here](https://people.eecs.ku.edu/~n676m982/EECS-647-Project/index.php)!

This is a delivery service app that was made with my [classmate](https://github.com/r211b673) in EECS 647 at the University of Kansas during the Spring of 2021. This project definitely could be cleaned up quite a bit and made much more pretty. It was our first time using Php and MySQL, so it was a good learning experience.
